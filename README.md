# neural_style_transfer
Neural Style Transfer toy project

I found it hard to transfer art style of pictures with more realistic image sizes (bigger, that is.)

Here are codes that tweaked various examples of neural style transfer, to fit with bigger images.

test run neural_style_tranfer.py converts content_1.jpg file to the style of style_1.jpg contained in content_imgs & style_imgs respectively

final result saved in result_imgs folder
